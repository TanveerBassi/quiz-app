# Code Quiz

## About this project?

This project was about creating a quiz of my choice - I chose to make quiz around coding. In making the quiz I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Also this project included using the DOM and local storage.

## Project Overview:

- When you navigate to the quiz - you will be prompted by the Quiz start up screen, with a quick description which includes a friendly message and making the user aware of the penalty of getting questions wrong.

- Once you press start quiz, a timer starts from 50 seconds to answer the questions, if you answer a question incorrectly the timer will deduct by 10 seconds, if not you will proceed to the next question. If you run out of time you will be sent to the leader board submission screen.

- Once you've completed the quiz you'll be prompted to enter your initials, and you can view the high scores when you press the back button, located in the top right hand corner of the screen.

- When you press the View High scores button on the top right hand corner of the screen you will be prompted by two buttons, go back and clear high scores. Go back will allow you to repeat the quiz and clear high scores will clear the high scores.
